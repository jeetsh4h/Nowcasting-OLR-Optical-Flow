# Nowcasting OLR via Deep Learning Techniques

train_model.ipynb file contains the code used to train, validate and evaluate the model that nowcasts OLR data across the Indian subcontinent. The nowcast leadtime is 3 hours, with 30 minute timesteps. 
The project is done with Kaushik Gopalan from Centre for inter-disciplinary AI, FLAME University and Dr. Bipasha Paul Shukla from Space Applications Centre, ISRO.

# Nowcasting-OLR-Optical-Flow

The above colab notebook is the source code written for precipitation nowcasting using OLR data pulled from INSAT-3D satellite, which is processed by MOSDAC. The paper is written for the course CSIT334 in FLAME University, taught by Prof. Jayaraman VK. The paper was written under the mentorship of Prof. Kaushik Gopalan and Prof. Jayaraman VK.

The code uses pySTEPS library to perform the optical flow, they are a wrapper for the OpenCV implementation.  

The students that conducted this study are Jeet Shah and Archit Murali.
